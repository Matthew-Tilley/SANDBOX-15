(2) Anonymous function method
    I intuitively recognize this as being an anonymous function; no 
    problem there.  I also realize it is invoked by calling the
    variable name it is assigned to, then adding parens to call it
    as a function...no problem.

let funky = function(){
    alert("HEY!");
}

funky();





/*

(1) Function declaration method - I totally understand this / no problem.

function funky(){
    
    alert("HEY!");
    
}

funky();

*/
